Description
-------------------

This repository aims to test CoCalc, one of the most popular web-based cloud computing and course management platforms, in order to give suggestions on whether to use this platform for teaching or not. 

Pros & Cons
-------------------
- Pros
  - 95% similarity to JupyterNotebook (easy to use)
  - provides version control, "time travel", with excellent functionality
  - supports more than 10 softwares and configurations files
  - easy to deploy (quick to setup)
  
- Cons
  - incompatibility with GitHub
  - limited shared RAM (1000MB) and disk space (3000MB)
  - installing additional packages requires membership and request submissions
  
  
Summary
-------------------
Overall, I do not think CoCalc is an efficient and effective tool for teaching a Machine Learning workshop with following reasons:

- Installing packages requires membership and is time-consuming.
- CoCalc has relatively smaller shared RAM and Storage, running complex models (such as Convolutional neural network) will results in a killed kernel.
